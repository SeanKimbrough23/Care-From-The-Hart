# Care From The Hart


Care From The Hart is an application I built for my mom Dr. Dionne Hart. I designed the app to streamline the process of booking Dr. Dionne Hart, a clinical psychiatrist and renowned speaker, for speaking engagements and presentations. As the developer of this application, I created it specifically to cater to Dr. Hart's busy schedule, which involves traveling across the country to attend annual meetings, conferences, and sessions where she delivers insightful presentations on various topics. I chose the color scheme based off her sorority Alpha Kappa Alpha. In addition to her clinical practice, Dr. Hart is actively involved in professional association boards and runs a successful consulting business.

The primary goal of Care From The Hart is to provide an efficient and user-friendly platform for individuals and organizations interested in booking Dr. Hart as a keynote speaker or presenter for their events. The application offers a range of features that enable users to explore Dr. Hart's background, read her biography, and view her professional portfolio.

Upon launching the app, users are introduced to different aspects of Dr. Hart's biography, allowing them to gain a deeper understanding of her journey in the medical field and the experiences that have shaped her expertise. They can then navigate to the portfolio section, where they can access past publications and articles written by Dr. Hart or featuring her work. This provides users with valuable insights into Dr. Hart's professional accomplishments and areas of focus.

Furthermore, Care From The Hart incorporates a calendar feature that displays Dr. Hart's availability. Users can conveniently check her schedule to determine if she is free during their desired event date. If a suitable time slot is available, users can proceed to the request booking page/form. This form allows them to submit a booking request, specifying the details of their event and their requirements for Dr. Hart's involvement.

As the application's developer, I have plans to further enhance and expand this project once I complete my software engineering program. My vision is to make it applicable not only to Dr. Hart but to any professional who frequently travels and delivers presentations. Future updates will include additional features that cater to the specific needs of professionals in various industries.

Care From The Hart aims to simplify the process of booking a highly respected and sought-after speaker like Dr. Dionne Hart. By providing a centralized platform for exploring her background, accessing her portfolio, and requesting bookings, this application facilitates efficient communication and streamlines the event planning process.
